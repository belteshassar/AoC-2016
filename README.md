# Advent of Code 2016

In this repo I collect my solutions for
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2016. Some of them I'm proud
of and some of them I'm less proud of.

The recommended version of Python is 3.5 or higher. Most solutions will
run on older versions. Specifically, some solutions contain advanced
unpacking which is only available from Python 3.5.
